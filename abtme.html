                        I'm born and raised singaporean living in singapore.
                        I am currently an secondary school student at Yuhua secondary school and taking this course,
                        CS50.
                        A few of my hobbies include programming and messing around with lasers for fun.
                        I got into programming at the age of 14, learning how to program in C# for using the Unity
                        game engine for game development.
                        I got into lasers as an hobby when i was around 11 years old as it piqued my interest due to
                        what i could learn about light from it.
