                            One of my hobbies is Programming, the activity of
                            writing coded instructions for an automatic
                            performance of an task for a computer or any other
                            machine. I started learning programming with the
                            intention to make games using the Unity game engine
                            learning C# along the way. But as time went on, I
                            found CS50x, while i did not bother much about the
                            course when i first saw it, I eventually decided to
                            take it and found it amazing and now, here I am!

                            Another hobby of mine is messing around with lasers,
                            it simply started when a tution teacher of mine
                            showed us how a green laser pointer when shone in
                            the dark could create a visible beam. I found it
                            really cool at that time and eventually settled to
                            buy one for myself. You can do many cool things with
                            lasers, whether be it burning things with light or
                            using mirrors to reflect the beam to create a cool
                            effect. Which is it piqued my interest and decided
                            to buy one for myself!
